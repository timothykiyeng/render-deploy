Close the bat angle slightly. Rotate backwards from the waist. As the ball approaches, rotate forwards and move your bat forwards and up. Contact the ball just in front of your body. The contact should be quite flat, roughly in the middle of your bat. Your bat should follow through and finish in front of your body", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNZrtYsvKhE")

Plan your serve to exploit your strengths and your opponent‚Äôs weaknesses. Employ a short toss up ‚Äì enough to give yourself time to hit the ball and also so that you‚Äôre unlikely to miss", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oL5BQuBuMHY")

Wait for the ball to bounce off your table upwards. Move your arm forward and upwards, brushing the ball at a ‚Äú‚Äô/‚Äù angle from a high position. The ball‚Äôs trajectory will arch downwards, picking up speed after it bounces off the table", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/--CEqSDd5yQ")
